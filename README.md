# ubuntu_22_04_platformio_setup_script
Everything I had to run in the terminal to setup a decent dev environment on a new Ubuntu 22.04. This is just a simple install script

Just sign into your accounts, install the platformio ide extension in code, install whatever other extensions you want and you are good to go.

May need to download a driver or two if the specific microcontroller/inline debugger needs a special USB driver
